Description:
Main goal was to try building a website from scratch using NodeJS, ReactJS, Webpack and Materialize-css.
The website itself represents a possible website promoting my movie-making skills (simplified version).

Installation:
npm install (installing all packages and dependencies)
npm start (staring the localhost server)

Status:
Finished for technology demonstation and practice purposes.

What'd need to be done to make it fully functional:
Enable/change some links' functionality.
Improve story told + possibly colors (depending on A/B testing).

What I learned:
To build a simple website for promotion of a product.
To tell a story and write an appealing content = storytelling was huge here for me.
Use Materialize-css framework + customize it.
That full-website deployment of NodeJS webpack-based can be a pain in the ass and making it work could
be a miracle (unless you find something like surge.sh which solves your deployment nightmare, haha).
Sometimes sacrificing some extra tools can be a real win (usage of react-create-app) would solve many
problems I struggled with.

Possible improvements for future:
Create responsivity - remove inline styling and create separate .css files for every part (component). 
However, this website is really clean and simple, therefore perhaps customized graphics would help.
Add on-line e-mail form.
Dev vs deployment version, customized webpack setup.
HMR for faster developemnt.
